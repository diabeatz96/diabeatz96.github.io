        <h3>Tourism in Australia</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Tourism in Australia is an important part of the Australian economy, and consists of domestic and international components. In the financial year 2014/15,
            tourism represented 3.0% of Australia's GDP contributing A$47.5 billion to the national economy.[2] In 2019, the contribution was a record $44.6 billion.[3]
            Domestic tourism is a significant part of the tourism industry, representing 73% of the total direct tourism GDP.[2]
            The Covid-19 pandemic impacted international tourist arrivals as Australia closed its international borders in March 2020,
            but relatively low levels of cases in some regions of the country meant that domestic travel was still possible.
            As of November 2021, borders for Australia have now been opened and fully vaccinated Australians are permitted to fly overseas without exemption.
            Currently New Zealand citizens are allowed to enter the country,
            and Singaporean citizens are expected to be next and be allowed to enter Australia from as early as 21 November 2021.[4][5]
            In the calendar year 2015, there were 7.4 million international visitors in Australia,[6] and 8.6 million in the year to June 2019, an
            increase of 3%.[3] Tourism employed 580,800 people in Australia in 2014–15, 5% of the workforce.[2] About 43.7% of persons employed in tourism were part-time.
            Tourism also contributed 8.0% of Australia's total export earnings in 2010–11.[2]]</p>
