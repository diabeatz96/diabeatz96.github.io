        <p>Lake Hillier is a saline lake on the edge of Middle Island, the largest of the islands and islets that make up the Recherche Archipelago in the Goldfields-Esperance region, off the south coast of Western Australia. It is particularly notable for its pink colour. A long and thin shore divides the Southern Ocean (by some definitions, the Indian Ocean) from the lake..</p>

        <p>Lake Hillier is about 600 metres (2,000 ft) in length by about 250 m (820 ft) in width.[2] The lake is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus trees[3] with a narrow strip of sand dunes covered by vegetation separating its northern edge from the northern coast of Middle Island. The most notable feature of the lake is its pink, vibrant colour. </p>
